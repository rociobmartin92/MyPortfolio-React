              I'm a Chemical Engineer and a Software developer specialized in
              Frontend UI.
              <br />I have a solid background based on years of work creating
              mobile and web apps using React Native and React.js as the main
              libraries. I have some experience leading teams and contributing
              to open-source projects. I have been working alone for some
              clients but I prefer to work in a team.
              <br />I consider myself an active and constantly motivated woman
              who wants to learn everything all the time. I'm in constant
              movement towards growing as a professional by staying up to date
              with modern technologies and every-day-changing standards.
              <br />
              I'm currently located in Argentina but I will move to Spain soon,
              that's why I am looking for a job there, please keep in touch with
              me in case my service and expertise would help you.
